# Abstract
The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) has infected more than 151 million people and caused approximately 3.17 million deaths around the world up to the present. The rapid spread of COVID-19 is continuing to threaten humanâ€™s life and health. Therefore, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems based on machine and deep learning methods which are able to accurately differentiate COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT) and X-Ray datasets is essential and of immediate priority. Different from most of the previous studies which used either one of CT or X-ray images, we employed both data types with sufficient samples in implementation. On the other hand, due to the extreme sensitivity of this pervasive virus, model uncertainty should be considered, while most previous studies have overlooked it. Therefore, we propose a novel powerful fusion model named _UncertaintyFuseNet_ that consists of an uncertainty module: Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) dropout. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of our proposed fusion for COVID-19 detection using CT scan and X-Ray datasets. Also, our proposed _UncertaintyFuseNet_ model is significantly robust to noise and performs well with the previously unseen data.
